- 👋 Hi, I’m @JCraigLBCC
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the system. Just getting started. I am an instructor at Long Beach City College. 
- I teach mostly Information system related, but like a lot of CIS instructors, we teach anything we are called on to teach.
- The California Community College System has a way to "Qualify" instructors in any given department. For instance, a instructor teaching Computer Science Courses is required to have a Graduate Degree, in Computer Science. If an instructor taught in the "Computer Information Systems" department, they COULD qualify with a CompSci degree, OR even with a Business Degree, like a MBA, or MIS, IF they had experience in teaching, applications, or networking, or even NON CompSci related programming.
